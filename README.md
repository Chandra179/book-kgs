# Book Recommendations Knowledge Graph System

## Overview

A comprehensive knowledge graph system for book recommendations that leverages multiple data sources, advanced graph algorithms, and interactive visualizations to provide personalized book suggestions based on complex relationships between books, authors, genres, themes, and user preferences.

## System Architecture

The system operates through multiple phases, each building upon the previous to create a robust recommendation engine powered by graph-based relationships and machine learning algorithms.
